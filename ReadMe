# 🐵 Bantering Baboon (SpeakPace)

**Bantering Baboon** is the internal codename for **SpeakPace** — a personal **speech-coaching web app** that analyses pacing, filler words, and emphasis in spoken delivery.
The name fits your playful ecosystem of code-names (*Hungry Panda* for Entrepreneurship Hub, *Groovy Gibbon* for another prototype): “Bantering Baboon” captures fluency, rhythm, and expressive energy — the very essence of speech confidence.

## 🎙️ What It Does

SpeakPace lets users upload a **short voice note** (≈ 60 – 300 seconds) and automatically generates:

* 🎚 **Pace Heatmap** — words-per-minute plotted over time
* 🗣 **Filler-Word Report** — counts and spikes for “um”, “uh”, “like”, etc.
* 🎧 **Emphasis Map** — visualises pitch and intensity to show where energy drops or peaks
* 🧾 **Auto-Generated Scripts** — 60-second and 5-minute practice scripts with rhythm markers
* 📑 **Annotated PDF Report** — all analytics and recommendations in a single downloadable file

It’s designed for **presenters, interviewees, and public-speaking students** who want rapid, data-driven feedback on their speaking pace and delivery.

## 🚀 MVP Focus

The MVP is intentionally **simple and fast**:

* Single-user or coach-led SaaS workflow
* Upload → Analyse → Download
* No admin dashboard or multi-role system
* Works locally (FastAPI backend + React frontend)
* Offline-first mode planned for edge deployments

## 🛠 Frontend Setup (React + Vite + Tailwind v3)

From your root project folder (`/Users/beard/Documents/GitHub/bantering-baboon`):

```bash
# 1. Create the frontend
npm create vite@latest baboon-frontend -- --template react
cd baboon-frontend

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install
npm install -D tailwindcss@3 postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
npm install react-router-dom

# 3. Configure Tailwind
# In tailwind.config.js:
content: ["./index.html", "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],

# 4. Enable Tailwind in src/index.css:
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

# 5. Run the app
npm run dev
```

Test by editing `src/App.jsx`:

```jsx
export default function App() {
  return (
    <div className="flex h-screen items-center justify-center bg-gray-900 text-white">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold">🚀 Bantering Baboon / SpeakPace is live!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 💡 Vision

Bantering Baboon (SpeakPace) is more than a voice analyser — it’s a **personal rhythm coach** that helps people speak with clarity, pace, and confidence.
The long-term goal is to evolve it into a **full performance analytics suite** for voice, tone, and engagement — bringing real-time AI feedback to anyone who speaks for a living.
